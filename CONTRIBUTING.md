I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition and I hope you all learn something new along the way.

If you haven't already, come find us in Discord (https://discord.gg/du6tZtd). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to https://github.com/Zevphyr/Collab-web/new/master with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests: https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). Please retrict it to one feature per commit.

Where possible and within reason, keep your code compatible for use across Operating Systems; it should ideally work cross platform with no loss of function or tedious workarounds.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "title"

    "A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

The current version of this application at the time of writing is "1.0.0"; When commiting, the title should be held to this format: 

Valkyr 1[Major Revision].0[feature].0[bugfix]

A commit to fix a bug or other minor QOL improvement would appear as:

 Valkyr 1.0.1
  



Thank you!
